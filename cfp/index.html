    <h2>Call for Papers and Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
        The production domain is permeated by heterogeneous data sources, a variety of IT systems, and complex
        industrial use cases - aspects that offer a very exciting field for research. Modern production systems
        have a large number of sensors for monitoring industrial plants, which help to gain an insight into a
        system’s state. Sensors produce large data sets with intricate details, necessitating comprehensive
        preprocessing. This preprocessing includes mechanisms to reduce the data quantity, including temporal
        and qualitative reduction of data. For instance, colored images may be converted to black-and-white ones,
        and information needs to be enriched with metadata. We have to handle all of these dimensions to be able
        to define the data sets that are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the abundance of data and the consequent potential for optimization, current approaches for
        dealing with the complexity of production systems are often ad-hoc, or siloed—both across disparate
        domains and through varying layers of information architecture, from machine-level execution systems to
        business processes. The primary goal of this workshop is to bring different research perspectives
        together and discuss use cases, needed modeling methods, and current research on modeling in (and for)
        production. We seek to explore a range of methods and tools, with a focus on their applicability for
        real-world production systems. Ultimately, this workshop strives to pave the way for a new generation of
        modeling tools and techniques that are capable of capturing the multi-faceted complexity of modern
        production environments, thereby enabling more informed decision-making processes and, in turn,
        elevating both productivity and sustainability.
